DummyPKPD	A basic test of the EventScheduler and Tiago's drug code
CevCq		As DummyPKPD; slightly better perhaps
Empirical		A test for the Empirical within-host model
IPT                   Another IPT test

Vector		 used for various tests and has changed a few times
VecTest		Vector model scenario; intended to remain unchanged as a test-case
VecFullTest	Vector model scenario with many interventions added and 3 vector species; a test-case of more-or-less everything the Vector model can do, all at once.
NamawalaArabiensis	Like VecTest but with different mosquito parameters
VecMonthly      Test using monthly EIR inputs instead of Fourier coefficients.

Cohort          A test for cohorts.
EffectiveDrug   A test for EventScheduler clinical model using an artificial 100% effective drug, with no lasting effect.
ESCMTest        Another EventScheduler model test.
Molineaux       A test for the Molineaux 1-day timestep infection model.

Uninfect        A scenario using special interventions to uninfect humans and vectors.

To list which model options are used, use one of the following commands:
cd ../build; test/run.py -- --print-model
grep option *.xml       # this also lists survey outputs
