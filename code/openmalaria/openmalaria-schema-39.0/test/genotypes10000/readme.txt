These are some scenarios used to test the genotype tracking.

Arguably scenarioGenotypes10000 is a better demonstrator of genotype tracking
than the scenarioGenotypes used for testing (in the parent directory),
but the latter runs faster using higher levels of resistant strains
(which would otherwise go extinct in such a small population).
