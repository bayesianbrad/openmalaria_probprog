This file lists significant changes in OpenMalaria from the point of view of
users. It is however far from complete. The more complete changelog is on the

## Vivax changes

<primaquine> has been renamed to <liverStageDrug>
Monitoring option nPQTreatments has been renamed to nLiverStageTreatments

## Backwards-compatible schema changes

Intervention usage:

<GVI> and <IRS> now have an optional <usage> element.
ITN's <usage> child element  is now optional too.
It is assumed, that when no <usage> child is given, the usage modifier is 100% (proportion of use for a given intervention, which modifies the protectional effect).

## Schema changes requiring updates to scenario XMLs

MDA and MDA1D intervention components replaced:
    
    The "MDA1D" component has been replaced with "decisionTree", a component
    which runs a case management decision tree on deployment; this is now
    usable with 5-day timestep models and gives a flexible way to implement T&T
    or similar campaigns.
    
    The "MDA" component has been replaced with "screen", "treatSimple" and
    "treatPKPD" components. The first of these uses a diagnostic and optionally
    triggers deployment of one or more other components on positive and/or
    negative outcomes while the latter offer two ways of treating infections.

## Backwards-compatible schema changes

Some of these changes offer additional functionality and some are recommended
but optional changes to enhance clarity of the XML or improve models. Running
OpenMalaria with the --deprecation-warnings option will print messages
recommending possible changes in XML documents.

Time units (improved clarity):

    Previously dates and durations were given in days, time steps or years with
    only a little documentation to indicate which unit should be used. Now
    most of these inputs accept units of days, steps or years with an explicit
    unit, and in the case of absolute times (i.e. not durations), dates.

Diagnostics (bug fixes, new capabilities):

    Previously the diagnostic used for monitoring purposes was deterministic
    with a specified detection limit, interpreted as being derived from either
    Garki or common (non-Garki) microscopy methods, while diagnostics used by
    the health system and intervention deployment could be either stochastic or
    deterministic with configurable limits but did not adjust these for the
    density estimation method (bug). Now all diagnostics can be specified with
    Garki, common or Malaria-therapy detection limits as deterministic or
    stochastic tests. Further, the diagnostic used by the neonatal mortality
    model may be independant of that used in monitoring.

Parasite genetics (new model):

    A new model has been introduced for selecting parasite genetics, with
    specification of initial genotype frequency and fitness, and (vector
    transmission model only) optional tracking of genotype frequency.
    
    This replaces the simplistic genotype model previously embedded within the
    PK/PD model and allows modeling the spread of drug resistance in
    OpenMalaria.

Monitoring (more options, some non-backwards-compatible changes):

    Much of the monitoring code was rewritten to be easier to extend. XML
    configuration and output files remain backwards compatible but with new
    options: output identifier is configurable, measures can be configured to
    aggregate over some dimensions (age group, cohort, species, genotype)
    to reduce output size, new measures (for tracking parasite genetics)
    are available.
    
    Vector species was previously indicated via name in output files but is
    now numeric.
    
    Some measures have been disabled (which?).

Health system (clarity, new capabilities):
    
    A new health system model is available (essentially a merge of the old
    ImmediateOutcomes and unused EventScheduler) models. This specifies
    access and severe outcomes as the ImmediateOutcomes model but uses
    decision trees to describe uncomplicated treatment. As with the
    ImmediateOutcomes model, this is only functional on a 5-day timestep.

Molineaux infection model (bug fixes):
    
    The Molineaux infection model has been improved slightly. Most notably,
    blood volume is derived from human age (giving infants lower volume and
    higher parasite density elimination thresholds), and parameter sampling
    for new infections has been fixed (non-pairwise-sampling mode).
    
    New testing code has also been written for the model.

## Tool changes

The plotResults.py script was updated to handle new outputs and allow plotting
results by cohort and genotype (on x-axis as separate lines).

Cohorts / sub-populations:

Concept of _cohorts_ partially replaced with _sub-populations_: intervention
deployments are sub-population recruitments while cohorts are a derived
concept only used in monitoring. Deployments can be restricted to
sub-populations (and their complements) instead of cohorts and cumulative
deployment mode uses sub-populations.

Getting output from multiple cohorts and/or cohort complements independently is
now possible.

Sub-population removal of membership on age of intervention (time since
deployment), first bout/infection/treatment event and ITN attrition.

Health system memory resets (reporting events which could have a relapse) on
remove-on-first-event sub-population removals (same as before), but not on
recruitment (which did used to happen).

Other:

Case management can use diagnostics before treating patients.

Case management can trigger deployment of any intervention.

New 'screen' intervention component which uses a diagnostic, then deploys
interventions from a list depending on outcome. Replaces MDA's diagnostic.

Integration of vivax code from the separate development branch based on schema
31.

Bug fixes. Significant cleanup of monitoring code. More restrictive parsing of
treatment descriptions (but not restricting anything actually useful).


— Schema 31 —

Replace "larviciding" intervention with far more generic "vectorPop" intervention.
