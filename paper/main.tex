\title{Applied Interpretable Inference: Connecting Probabilistic Programming with Epidemology Simulators}

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\begin{abstract}

A goal of probabilistic programming is to couple simulators, with inference. This is 
because stochastic simulators are used prominently in many industrial settings,
do not require one to construct hand-crafted joint distributions as they implicitly 
define a joint distribution of the program and encode learnt structures 
directly. This makes simulators powerful tools and much of machine learning (ML) and 
Artificial Intelligence (AI)
can be seen as trying to emulate such simulators from a purely data-driven approach.
However, in the 
ML/AI setting, although we can often infer outcomes, we have little understanding about what 
in the data led to the outputted inferences. 
This makes it challenging to deploy ML/AI systems into the wild, especially in health-related and safety-critical domains, such
as epidemiology, as we lose \emph{interpretability}. 
In this work, we explain how to design ML/AI systems that combine
probabilistic programming systems (PPSs) and epidemiology simulators, to extract
fully interpretable posterior structures, enabling policy makers 
and practitioners to make interpretable inferences. 
In particular, we demonstrate this for the Malaria disease and show how we can 
perform interpretable inference in such settings.

\section{Introduction}

To do. 

\begin{itemize}

\item Outline the objectives
\item State the importance of interpretability in the inference of the simulator
\item Our system enables one to understand and interpret the most common paths in a program (simulation).
\item In highlighting this a practitioner can then go back to the field and explore that parameter/s in more depth.
\item This facilitates understanding and the construction of more detailed models and data collection strategies

\end{itemize}
